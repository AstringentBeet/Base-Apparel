## Updates:

  #### 01/31/2022, 2257 CDT:  
  Before you continue, reorganize the semantic elements and figure out how to properly position the hero image.
  
  #### 2/03/2022, 0354 CDT:  
  commenting the margins out within the text.css file removed the whitespace at the top of the body (when looking in the desktop screen).
  - I never realized the degree of specificity involved when working solely on positions and block placement. I need to go over both CSS inheritance and specificity to better understand the more minor details that I skimmed through.    

  Here some objectives to complete before the next commit:
   - Create a third querey that goes beyond a landscaped width of 1280 pixels.
   - Center both the page-content and footer (with the footer being horizontally alligned with the page-content).
   - Find the appropriate percentages for said blocks to better the page's overall responsiveness.
   - pretty-up the rest of the page and remove the border guides.
   - revise class names to better fit the BEM naming convention. 
  #### 02/04/2022, Part 1/2, 1924 CDT:  
  After scanning through various articles on the web, I was finally able to find the code to center the hero image on the desktop version of the page. In the proccess of this, relying solely on floats and block positioning has forced me to gain a better idea of certain concepts such as inheritance, the box-model, and surface-level basics of pseudo-elements (which adds an additional 'block' to the model).
  - This is one of two planned commits for the rest of the day. The next one will actually focus on previous obejectives.
  - ~~Turns out that adding the max-height property was the missing piece in fitting the hero image into the aside container (technically the pseudo-element), allowing it the overall picture to be vertically centered.~~
    - ~~Figuring this out took about 7 hours an ungodly amount of time.~~   
  - ~~There wasn't a need to set the footer's position to absolute in the mobile platform, but it was absolutely (pun-intended) needed for the desktop platform due to said tag being outside of the rest of the content. Doing so removes the footer from the flow, which places (technically) it inside the main content.~~
  #### 02/05/2022
  Styled the desktop page (with a width of 1440) a bit more.
   - After realising how little I know about positioning, proper box styling, and "legacy Layouts, I'm going to dive more into CSS fundamentals. 

   #### 03/15/2022
   It's been well over a month of trying to figure out how to position certain objects (specifically centering the hero image) without the aid of table displays, legacy grids (such as 960), flexbox, and CSS grids. Obviously, it didn't pan out well. How did developers go about positioning just using floats and clears? 
   - Decided to apply the table display to the hero image by wrapping it within two containers, allowing me to vertically center it without the need to lose hair about it. 
   - Removed the border "guides" and completed the basic design for both mobile and desktop. 
   - Added the gradient SVG background.
     - Unsure if it should be a background image using CSS. With that, the SVG is awkward due to the pattern abruptly stopping. I need to learn how to use gradients with CSS. 
     - Now I just need to apply Javascript.

## Overview

### Project objectives

There are a few challenges that I made for myself in the process of creating this branch:  
- I'm a stubborn dude, and in order to understand CSS fundamentals, I'm gonna focus  
on creating the layout by altering block positions using both floats and clears.  
  - this excludes the use of flexbox and CSS grids. Although some may not see  
  the point in taking these extra steps, this porject serves more as an experiment  
  that'll allow me to better understand how programmers managed to configure layouts without the convenient newer technologies we have now.
    - on a side note, I will not be using table grids...for now.
- By confining myself to these restrictions, I'll better understand how to manipulate the DOM from various perspectives using Javascript.
- This also serves as practice for better understanding git and virtual control systems as a whole.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
