## Progress-Log:

  #### 01/31/2022, 2257 CDT:  
  Before you continue, reorganize the semantic elements and figure out how to properly position the hero image.
  
  #### 2/03/2022, 0354 CDT:  
  commenting the margins out within the text.css file removed the whitespace at the top of the body (when looking in the desktop screen).
  - I never realized the degree of specificity involved when working solely on positions and block placement. I need to go over both CSS inheritance and specificity to better understand the more minor details that I skimmed through.    

  Here some objectives to complete before the next commit:
   - Create a third querey that goes beyond a landscaped width of 1280 pixels.
   - Center both the page-content and footer (with the footer being horizontally alligned with the page-content).
   - Find the appropriate percentages for said blocks to better the page's overall responsiveness.
   - pretty-up the rest of the page and remove the border guides.
   - revise class names to better fit the BEM naming convention. 
  #### 02/04/2022, Part 1/2, 1924 CDT:  
  After scanning through various articles on the web, I was finally able to find the code to center the hero image on the desktop version of the page. In the proccess of this, relying solely on floats and block positioning has forced me to gain a better idea of certain concepts such as inheritance, the box-model, and surface-level basics of pseudo-elements (which adds an additional 'block' to the model).
  - This is one of two planned commits for the rest of the day. The next one will actually focus on previous obejectives.
  - ~~Turns out that adding the max-height property was the missing piece in fitting the hero image into the aside container (technically the pseudo-element), allowing it the overall picture to be vertically centered.~~
    - ~~Figuring this out took about 7 hours an ungodly amount of time.~~   
  - ~~There wasn't a need to set the footer's position to absolute in the mobile platform, but it was absolutely (pun-intended) needed for the desktop platform due to said tag being outside of the rest of the content. Doing so removes the footer from the flow, which places (technically) it inside the main content.~~
  #### 02/05/2022
  Styled the desktop page (with a width of 1440) a bit more.
   - After realising how little I know about positioning, proper box styling, and "legacy Layouts, I'm going to dive more into CSS fundamentals. 

   #### 03/15/2022
   It's been well over a month of trying to figure out how to position certain objects (specifically centering the hero image) without the aid of table displays, legacy grids (such as 960), flexbox, and CSS grids. Obviously, it didn't pan out well. How did developers go about positioning just using floats and clears? 
   - Decided to apply the table display to the hero image by wrapping it within two containers, allowing me to vertically center it without the need to lose hair about it. 
   - Removed the border "guides" and completed the basic design for both mobile and desktop. 
   - Added the gradient SVG background.
     - Unsure if it should be a background image using CSS. With that, the SVG is awkward due to the pattern abruptly stopping. I need to learn how to use gradients with CSS. 
     - Now I just need to apply Javascript.

  #### 03/23/2022
  Applying a gradient transition was a bit tricky since CSS doesn't have a mehtodology to directly deal with that. As a result, and after some digging on the web, applying a transition to a gradient could only be achieved by transitioning an element's (and it's subsequent pseudo-element) opacity to what it was `::before`. The next step is to create an error message within the body (in contrast to the common alert function) using AJAX and Regex. Sure, it's much easier utilizing JQuery for something such as this, but I need to understand how to apply this knowing my code with confidence.
  - changed `background-color` to `background-image` in order to utilize gradient transition.
    - the button color would have changed abrutly without smooth animation if I were to use `background-color` instead.
  - Created a `::before` pseudo-element for my `.btn` class in order to have both elements change color smoothly.
  - changed CSS color values to RGB and RGBA due to HSL not supporting the specific color I needed for the button.
  - Applying AJAX to both detect and inform the client if they made an error (invalid email) directly below the input field using a transitionary fade-in animation. The input's border should also transition with an equal speed and smoothness as the message and button. This border, message, and button, will disspear once it the client's email is validated, meaning that it'll make use of recognizing a wide variety of Regular Expressions. 


#### 05/09/2022
After trying to understand the reason why all the elements within the form tag looked softer in contrast to the original Figma file, it occured to me (I should also give credit to Stackoverflow for assistance) that all the child selectors within the `<form>` tag had an opacity of .5, which naturally made every single element, even SVG files, susceptible to deviating away from their assigned color. To resolve this, removing the opacity property from the form selector and replacing the color value from RGB to RGBA for all child selectors removed te issue completely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began adding the error shading, but I need to utilize Javascript to form CSS transitions based on Regex. As it turns out, this doesn't require AJAX.

#### 05/10/2022
Remember:
- The regular border for `form.email` is `border: 1px solid rgba(206, 152, 152, .5);`
  - Once an invalid address is entered, the border is `border: 2px solid rgb(249, 100, 100);`
  - `icon-error` has a defaulted display of none, except when the address is invalid.
- `margin-top` for `input.email--input` is set to -.5px if border is set to 2px; it will be -1px if border is 1px.
- `margin-top` for `.btn` is set to -2px once border is set to 2px. -1px if border is 1px.

#### 05/11/2022; 1556
I tested out an algorithm that I found through doing some digging on Github. One of which was
```js
function init (){
  submit.addEventListener('click', function() {
    if(!reg.test(input.value.toLowerCase())){
      formBorder.style.transition="all 1s ease"
      formBorder.style.border = "2px solid rgb(249, 100, 100)";
      iconError.style.transition = "color ease-in-out 1s"
      iconError.style.display = "inline-block";
      validityText.style.color = "rgb(249, 100, 100)";
      validityText.style.transition = "ease 1s";
      validityText.style.display = "inline-block";
      validityText.innerHTML = "Please provide a valid email.";
    } else{
      formBorder.style.transition="all 1s ease"
      formBorder.style.border = "1px solid green";
      validityText.style.transition = "color ease-in-out 1s";
      validityText.innerHTML = "Email Sent!";
      validityText.style.color = "green";
      iconError.style.display = "none";
    }
  })
}
init();
```
Of course, this code was partially edited to work for my page. The now resolved issue that stemmed from working hrough this was involving the HTML. Although the email input's border changed color and stroke, the page immediately reoladed, completely going back to it's default appearance. The issue started due to my use of a form tag, which is, what I now know, used to send and recieve data from a server. replacing `<form>` with a regular `<div>` tag worked solely for testing out if the code entered worked.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, text transitions utilizing Javascript is much more cumbersome than it's seemingly worth. At least in the moment, it is.
- remember to add a transformation for the div border. The color has a smooth transition, but the partial incrememnt in size just looks clunky.

#### 05/12/2022; 1415
I need to create a two functions â€“ one for creating a smooth display transition for the icon-error, the other for a resize transition for border size and button's margin alteration. This project has taken a lot longer than I would have wanted it to go, but I guess it's a part of the learning process. I'm starting to appreciate the use of libraries and frameworks.

#### 05/12/2022; 1833
I'll go ahead and claim this project as completed, but only in terms of accomplishing all of the required tasks. I still intend to update this little page, but on my own terms. It was a tedious as it was educational and enjoyable, and I hope to have the next major update completed by next Thursday.


## Overview

### Project objectives

There are a few challenges that I made for myself in the process of creating this branch:  
- I'm a stubborn dude, and in order to understand CSS fundamentals, I'm gonna focus  
on creating the layout by altering block positions using both floats and clears.  
  - this excludes the use of flexbox and CSS grids. Although some may not see  
  the point in taking these extra steps, this porject serves more as an experiment  
  that'll allow me to better understand how programmers managed to configure layouts without the convenient newer technologies we have now.
    - on a side note, I will ~not~ be using table grids...for now.
- By confining myself to these restrictions, I'll better understand how to manipulate the DOM from various perspectives using Javascript.
- This also serves as practice for better understanding git and virtual control systems as a whole.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Recieve a success message when the email is entered correctly.
  - Both messages should have a smooth transition. This includes a color change in the
  `form` (which is now a `<div>` tag) border, and the display for the error-icon svg (CSS's tranisition property doesn't work for display, so I'll be using Javascript in conjuction with a hiiden CSS class).
